### In this Data Science Virtual Internship, We were given 5 tasks each containing different kind of Problems.

### Task 1
- `Task1` was to classify `Iris Dataset`. It was Classification Problem so I used SVM classifier which gave me 98% accuracy.
- Folder of `Task 1` contains its Jupyter Notebook.

### Task 2
- As Covid began, Unemployment also surged to its new height.
- In this task we have to `analyse Unemployment` across India.
- Folder of `Task 2` contains its dataset and Jupyter Notebook

### Task 3
- Task 3 was a Regression Problem.
- It was to `predict Car Price` based on the given data.
- I have tries multiple regressor for this task and `Random Forest Regressor` worked best.
- `Task 3` Folder contains it's CSV Dataset and Jupyter Notebook.

### Task 4
- Task 4 was a Problem of `Natural Language Processing`
- It was `to detect wheather email was spam or not`.
- For this I have used `SMOTE` as classes were imbalanced and used Logistic Regression for Prediction.
- Folder of `Task 4` contains Dataset and its Jupyter Notebook.

### Task 5
- Task 5 was again a Regression problem.
- It was `to predict Sales from Advertising Mediums like TV, Radio, Newspaper`.
- I have used `Decision Tree Regressor` for this Purpose.
- Folder of `Task 5` contains Dataset and its Jupyter Notebook.
